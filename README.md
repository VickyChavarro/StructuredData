- The objective of the present study was to characterise these municipalities using scalar variables, including population, altitude, area, economic activity and educational data. The aim was to understand the diversity and characteristics of the municipalities in order to support decision-making in socio-economic development, urban planning and resource allocation. The data were obtained from official sources, such as the Governorate of Boyacá and DANE, and underwent a cleaning and curation process to ensure quality and consistency.

- The modelling process involved the implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms the original variables into uncorrelated principal components. This transformation enabled the identification of patterns and relationships in the data, thereby simplifying the representation of municipalities while preserving the majority of the original variability. The PCA results were then evaluated and interpreted in terms of the contributions of the original variables, thereby revealing insights into the groupings and differences between municipalities. This analysis facilitated a more profound understanding of the structure of the data and highlighted the diversity within the department of Boyacá.
