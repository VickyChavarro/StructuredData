- The aim of the present study was to describe these municipalities using variables including population, altitude, area, economic activity and educational data. The aim was to understand the diversity and characteristics of the municipalities in order to support decision-making in socio-economic development, urban planning and resource allocation. The data came from official sources like the Governorate of Boyacá and DANE, and was checked to make sure it was correct and consistent.

- To do this, we used PCA. This transformation enabled the identification of patterns and relationships in the data, thereby simplifying the representation of municipalities while preserving the majority of the original variability. The PCA results were then checked and understood in terms of the original variables, which showed how the municipalities were grouped together and how they were different from each other. This analysis helped us understand the data better and showed us how different the municipalities in Boyacá are.
